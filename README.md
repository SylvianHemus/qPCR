What I'm planning to do this (as a response on Plusoone)

frcesca: What is the status of the project...? 2020

shemus: I'm not sure about the project, and I realize your comment is quite old. I am not associated with the project and am just a guy who wants a qPCR machine. However, for what it's worth I went ahead and posted the stuff up on github as I will likely make some changes to the files. At the very least, I'll change the .ino file into C/C++ stuff as I dislike the Arduino IDE / toolchain and prefer just writing C/C++ with emacs, this usually means using the ESP-IDF toolchain as it is relatively easy to get started and the ESP32 is a good choice, even for mass produced products, likely adding a web interface.


I'll document the process and may as well take the opportunity to try to replicate their paper, although probably not with lentivirus, lol. I can't promise a timeline but at the least I'll update my progress
