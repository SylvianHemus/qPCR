* Some interesting notes
** How my version might differ 
I usually use openscad and not autodesk
I don't like arduino IDE
I like using PLA
I like using modified ender 3
I use a sanesmart not a 3d CNC mcss built into the printer
I might prefer to use photolithography need to finish the paper
I use the HD44780 as a screen because I think it's a jellybean. I kinda want to use an amber backlight for more comfy feel 
* TODO Checkout Sparkfun MicroView

is ESP32 more of a jellybean (old faithful) contender
* TODO how much of the HD44780 is a jellybean
* Calibrating
Might be good to add calibrate feature to microcontroller to make sure it follows table on page 11/18
I should replicate this table
